## Keycloak theme configuration for the ATDT login screens

# Inherit from the built‑in “keycloak” theme so that we have all the
# standard layout templates and assets available.  We override the login
# templates and include our own stylesheet to align the pages with the
# Agencia de Transformación Digital y Telecomunicaciones (ATDT) design
# system.
parent=keycloak

# Import common resources from the keycloak base theme.  Without this the
# templates would not be able to resolve macros such as `layout` or
# `template`.  See the Keycloak documentation for more information on
# theme inheritance.
import=common/keycloak

# Register our custom stylesheet.  The file referenced here must live
# under the resources/css directory of the theme.  When Keycloak renders
# a page it will automatically insert a `<link>` tag for this file.
styles=css/style.css

# Public links used by the login template.  These can be overridden per
# deployment by adding the desired URLs here.  During development
# these default to “#” which results in no navigation.
